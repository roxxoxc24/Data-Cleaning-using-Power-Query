# Data-Cleaning-using-Power-Query

This project demonstrates how I combined, cleaned and transformed an unstructured data using the Power Query tool. 

The goal of this project is turn those data into accurate data so that it can be use for data analysis.

Feel free to add a new tab with table and refresh the consolidated table as I have made a dynamic worksheet.

****Note:** Table names should end with the word RawData.**
